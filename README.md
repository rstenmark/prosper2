## Prosper2

# Overview
Propser2 is a collection of Python (>=3.11) scripts for collecting and analyzing data from the game [Prosperous Universe](https://prosperousuniverse.com/). The data collected is focused on the Commodity Exchange (CX) mechanic, where players in a local area can exchange materials for currency. 

# Data source(s)
Currently, data is solely sourced from the [third-party "FIO" API](https://doc.fnar.net). This API sources its data from players who voluntarily install a browser extension to have game data automatically scraped and posted to the API for others to consume programmatically.
